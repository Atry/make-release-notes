# Experimental Backend in Scala 2.11

Scala 2.11 ships with an experimental backend named "GenBCode", originally implemented by [Miguel Garcia](https://github.com/magarciaEPFL).
This backend will become the new default in Scala 2.12.
Given that the new backend is experimental in Scala 2.11, it can be modified and extended without compatibility concerns.
Most of the work towards the Scala 2.12 backend happens in the 2.11 branch and flows into 2.11.x minor releases.

This gives you the chance to preview pieces of Scala 2.12 just by enabling some compiler flags in 2.11!

## Enabling GenBCode

`-Ybackend:GenBCode` enables the new backend.

GenBCode without any further compiler flags is a drop-in replacement for the current backend ("GenASM").
The generated bytecode is binary compatible, altough not exactly the same; some instruction sequences may differ.
If you find a binary incompatibility, please [report an issue](https://issues.scala-lang.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa).
